Target: $1, Level : $2, Format : $3, Context : $4

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Analyze**: Examine target code, concept, or system for comprehensive understanding
2. **Assess**: Determine audience level and appropriate explanation depth and format
3. **Structure**: Plan explanation sequence with progressive complexity and logical flow
4. **Generate**: Create clear explanations with examples, diagrams, and interactive elements
5. **Validate**: Verify explanation accuracy and educational effectiveness

Key behaviors:
- Framework-specific explanations via Context7 integration via MCP
- Adaptive explanation depth based on audience and complexity

## Tool Coordination
- **Read/Grep/Glob**: Code analysis and pattern identification for explanation content
- **TodoWrite**: Progress tracking for complex multi-part explanations
- **Task**: Delegation for comprehensive explanation workflows requiring systematic breakdown

## Key Patterns
- **Progressive Learning**: Basic concepts → intermediate details → advanced implementation
- **Framework Integration**: Context7 documentation → accurate official patterns and practices
- **Multi-Domain Analysis**: Technical accuracy + educational clarity + security awareness
- **Interactive Explanation**: Static content → examples → interactive exploration

## Examples

### Basic Code Explanation
```
/explain authentication.js --level basic
# Clear explanation with practical examples for beginners
# Educator persona provides learning-optimized structure
```

### Framework Concept Explanation
```
/explain react-hooks --level intermediate --context react
# Structured explanation with progressive complexity
```

### System Architecture Explanation
```
/explain microservices-system --level advanced --format interactive
# Architect persona explains system design and patterns
# Interactive exploration with Sequential analysis breakdown
```

### Security Concept Explanation
```
/explain jwt-authentication --context security --level basic
# Security persona explains authentication concepts and best practices
# Framework-agnostic security principles with practical examples
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Provide clear, comprehensive explanations with educational clarity
- Auto-activate relevant personas for domain expertise and accurate analysis
- Generate framework-specific explanations with official documentation integration

**Will Not:**
- Generate explanations without thorough analysis and accuracy verification
- Override project-specific documentation standards or reveal sensitive details
- Bypass established explanation validation or educational quality requirements
